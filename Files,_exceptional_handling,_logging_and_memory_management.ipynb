        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages\n",
        "-  A: Interpreted languages execute code line by line at runtime (e.g., Python), while compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code before execution (e.g., C++), resulting in faster execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python\n",
        "-  A: Exception handling is a mechanism to manage runtime errors using try, except, else, and finally blocks to prevent program crashes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling\n",
        "-   A: The finally block executes cleanup code regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python\n",
        "-  A: Logging records messages (errors, warnings, information) during program execution for debugging and tracking.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python\n",
        "-  A: __del__ is a destructor method automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed to perform cleanup tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python\n",
        "-   A: import module imports the entire module; from module import name imports specific attributes/functions/classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python\n",
        "-  A: Use multiple except blocks or a single except with a tuple of exceptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python\n",
        "-  A: It ensures the file is automatically closed after its block is executed, even if errors occur.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing\n",
        "-  A: Multithreading runs multiple threads within one process; multiprocessing runs multiple processes with separate memory spaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program\n",
        "-  A: Provides a record of events, aids debugging, allows severity levels, and avoids using print statements.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python\n",
        "-  A: The process of allocating and deallocating memory, managed automatically by Pythonâ€™s garbage collector.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python\n",
        "-   A: Wrap code in try, catch errors in except, optionally use else for code if no error occurs, and finally for cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python\n",
        "-   A: Prevents memory leaks, ensures efficient use of resources, and improves performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling\n",
        "-  A: try contains code that might raise an exception; except handles the exception if raised.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work\n",
        "-  A: It uses reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to free memory no longer in use.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling\n",
        "-  A: The else block runs only if no exceptions occur in the try block.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python\n",
        "-  A: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python\n",
        "-  A: os.fork() creates a child process in Unix; multiprocessing is a cross-platform module for process creation.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python\n",
        "-  A: Frees system resources and ensures all buffered data is written.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python\n",
        "-  A: read() reads the entire file; readline() reads one line at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for\n",
        "-  A: To record log messages of different severity levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling\n",
        "-  A: To interact with the operating system for tasks like file paths, creation, deletion, and checking existence.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python\n",
        "-  A: Circular references, large object storage, fragmentation, and unpredictable garbage collection timing.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python\n",
        "-  A: Use the raise statement, e.g., raise ValueError(\"message\").\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications\n",
        "-  A: To improve performance in I/O-bound tasks by allowing concurrent execution."
